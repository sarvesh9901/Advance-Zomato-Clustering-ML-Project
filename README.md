# Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
Zomato, founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008, is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery startup. It provides information, menus, and user reviews of restaurants, and offers food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data for various cities in India to gain insights, identify interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry, and provide useful conclusions in the form of visualizations.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze customer sentiments from reviews and cluster Zomato restaurants into different segments. This analysis will help customers find the best restaurants in their locality and assist the company in identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, the data provides valuable information on cuisine and costs, which can be used for cost vs. benefit analysis.

## Data Description
The project uses two main datasets:

### Zomato Restaurant Metadata:
- **Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Links**: URL links of the restaurants.
- **Cost**: Estimated cost per person for dining.
- **Collection**: Tagging of restaurants with respect to Zomato categories.
- **Cuisines**: Cuisines served by the restaurants.
- **Timings**: Restaurant timings.

### Zomato Restaurant Reviews:
- **Restaurant**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Reviewer**: Name of the reviewer.
- **Review**: Review text.
- **Rating**: Rating provided by the reviewer.
- **MetaData**: Reviewer metadata (number of reviews and followers).
- **Time**: Date and time of the review.
- **Pictures**: Number of pictures posted with the review.
